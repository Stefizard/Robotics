Line Follower

(Sorry for the vertical filming)

How to use:
Just plug the arduino board in (or connect a battery), and the Line Follower will start searching for a line to follow. 
If it doesn't find one, it will go in circles until it finds one. This also helps if the sensor ends up outside of a line to mantain the last curve that it took.
Note that the threshold was made specific for the board and line that I used, so modifications may be required.
Also, the motors' speed depends on the distance between the two wheels.
